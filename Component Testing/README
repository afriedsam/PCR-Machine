I do not reccomend putting everything together and running the master code file and expecting everything to work on the first try.
If you wish to replicate this project I reccomend testing all of your components seperately before testing them all together.
I have broken the master code up into 4 files.
  1) A code to test the relay
  2) A code to test the thermocouple (temperature sensor)
  3) A code to test the Joystick
  4) A code to test the LCD
Once you have tested all these and made sure that everything works, then you can start working on putting everything together.
